This is one of six homework assignments assigned by Professor Lowenthal in Brooklyn College's Data Structurs class during the Fall 2012 semester.  I can't vouch for the quality of the code, and I will note that it's heavily influenced by my experiences with Objective-C, but it's thoroughly commented and should be clean enough. 

It's free for the taking, so use it, don't abuse it.
