This is one of six homework assignments assigned by Professor Lowenthal in Brooklyn College's Data Structurs class during the Fall 2012 semester.  I can't vouch for the quality of the code, and I will note that it's heavily influenced by my experiences with Objective-C, but it's thoroughly commented and should be clean enough. 

The point of the assignment is to take data from File A (the transactions file), and merge it with data in File B (the accounts file). 

There are 2 types of transactions that can be in the transactions file: Order, or Payment. Each line has either one or the other. The contents of the line is denoted by an O or a P at the start of the line. After that, there's a 4 digit customer number. Then, orders will have an item, a quantity, and a price. Payments will have an amount. 

The idea is to read the data in from the transactions file and calculate the balance for each customer in the master file.

It's free for the taking, so use it, don't abuse it.
